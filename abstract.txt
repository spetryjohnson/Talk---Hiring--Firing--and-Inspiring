Hiring, Firing, and Inspiring a Great Team
Management gets a bad rap in technical circles, and for good reason: many managers are terrible, and it shows!

Rising above the pointy-haired-boss stereotypes is easier than you might think. By grounding your leadership style in management science, and adding a touch of emotional intelligence, you can help your team meet its individual and collective goals, improve morale and engagement, and reduce turnover.

This session will show early-career managers how to improve recruiting and retention via core values, how to communicate effectively with personality-typing tools like DISC, how to improve decision-making with a process called Cynefin, and how to "transition with empathy" when someone isn't working out.
Notes:
This is a new session for CodeMash 2020, but it's been something I've been thinking about for a long time.

I've gone through many trials by fire in my own management career and I've used a number of different resources to get through: Manager Tools podcast, books, seeking out leadership coaching from mentors, and networking with other management professionals. 

My goal in the session is to introduce managers and leaders to a world of concepts that they may be totally blind to so that they may improve their own management practice.
