# Hiring and Inspiring a Great Team

Management gets a bad rap in technical circles, and for good reason: many managers are terrible, and it shows!

Rising above the pointy-haired-boss stereotypes is easier than you might think. By grounding your leadership style in management science, and adding a touch of emotional intelligence, you can help your team meet its individual and collective goals, improve morale and engagement, and reduce turnover.

This session will show early-career managers how to find team players aligned with their core values, how to "design the alliance" with new hires, how to get the most out of 1:1s, and how to use personality-typing tools like DISC to motivate and communicate effectively.
